{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0c0cc8","input":"Tell us what has been your best work achievement to this point in your career. What made this achievement important?\n\nSchool teacher - Collate, process, present students results using tools such as Access, Excel\n\n4 major assessment periods every year. After every assessment, subject teachers have around a week to submit results to form teachers to be updated into MOE system. During this week, the subject teachers need to return scripts to students for checking, and update form teachers should there be any changes to marks.\n\nForm teachers would be receiving data from various subject teachers at different points in time, primarily because the data had to be vetted by department heads before submission to MOE.\n\nSchool leaders would be expecting reports of the results so that they can be updated of the situation, and possibly make deployment changes if neccessary.\n\nIt might come as a surprise that even though the workflow was well-understood by everyone, there was no standardised way of taking over of data, and herein lies the risk of data integrity.\n\nI started off by creating an Excel template for my personal use, which allowed me to present students' results together with a breakdown of the number of students who achieved various grades. It caught the attention of school leaders, and eventually I was put in charge of rolling it out schoolwide. Various enhancements were subsequently made based on feedback I gathered from teachers and school leaders, resulting in what we affectionately referred to as the Super Template.\n\nI feel that this was my most important work achievement because I saw how a good data management process could impact and enhance the work of both teachers and school leaders. While Excel wasn't the best tool for the job back then, I also saw the importance of choosing a tool that users are relatively familiar with.","pos":3,"type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a99fc7","input":"Describe a difficult task you were faced with and how you addressed it.\n\nBefore I became a school teacher, I had a part time role as an admin assistant. Along with several others, I was helping out with monitoring patient attendance and treatment status for a programme conducted at IMH. The challenge back then was having to work with data from multiple sources, as well as reporting on live data that was being created by others around me.\n\nI first established a common structure for the data entry process, so that compilation would go smoothly at my end. With that, I was able to get the rest of the team doing data entry to work cohesively.\n\nFor reporting, I made use of pivot tables, which was something I had to learn quickly at that point in time for the task. While I did research on several other tools, pivot tables were the quickest to implement back then. Possibly due to the number of pivot tables used, the updating of pivot tables got sluggish, and I had to manually refresh them.\n\nWhile there were various ways that the workflow could have been improved, that work experience early on in my career helped pave the way for my subsequent data-related roles.","pos":4,"type":"cell"}
