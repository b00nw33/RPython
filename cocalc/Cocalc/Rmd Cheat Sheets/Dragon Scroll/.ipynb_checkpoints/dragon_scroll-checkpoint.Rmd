**LAWS OF INDICES (6)**
\begin{align*}
a^m \times a^n &= a^{m+n} & a^\frac{m}{n} &= (\sqrt[n]{a})^m \\
a^m \div a^n &= a^{m-n} & a^{-m} &= \frac{1}{a^m} \\
(a^m)^n &= a^{m \cdot n} & a^0 &= 1

**LAWS OF LOGARITHMS (9)**
\begin{align*}
log_b(m \cdot n) &=  log_b m + log_b n \\
log_b(\frac{m}{n}) &=  log_b m - log_b n \\
log_b(m^k) &=  k \cdot log_b m \\
log_b n \cdot log_n m &= log_b m
\end{align*}
For $log_b m$, $m>0$ and $b>1$
\begin{align*}
log_n m &= \frac{log_b m}{log_b n} & log_b b &= 1 \\
log_b m &= \frac{1}{log_m b} & log_b 1 &= 0 \\
log_{b^k} m &= \frac{1}{k}log_b m

Another plot
```{r out.width="100%", echo=0}
library("ggplot2")
eq = function(x){x^2}
ggplot(data.frame(x=c(-5,5)), aes(x=x)) + 
  stat_function(fun=eq)
```
The above **plot** touches the x-axis at the origin.

You gotta let go of that stuff from the past
because it just doesn’t matter.
the only thing that matters is what you
choose to be now.
