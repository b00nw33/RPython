    "4 major assessment periods every year. After every assessment, subject teachers have around a week to submit results to form teachers to be updated into MOE system. During this week, the subject teachers need to return scripts to students for checking, and update form teachers should there be any changes to marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Form teachers would be receiving data from various subject teachers at different points in time, primarily because the data had to be vetted by department heads before submission to MOE.\n",
    "\n",
    "School leaders would be expecting reports of the results so that they can be updated of the situation, and possibly make deployment changes if neccessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might come as a surprise that even though the workflow was well-understood by everyone, there was no standardised way of taking over of data, and herein lies the risk of data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started off by creating an Excel template for my personal use, which allowed me to present students' results together with a breakdown of the number of students who achieved various grades. It caught the attention of school leaders, and eventually I was put in charge of rolling it out schoolwide. Various enhancements were subsequently made based on feedback I gathered from teachers and school leaders, resulting in what we affectionately referred to as the Super Template.\n",
    "\n",
    "I feel that this was my most important work achievement because I saw how a good data management process could impact and enhance the work of both teachers and school leaders. While Excel wasn't the best tool for the job back then, I also saw the importance of choosing a tool that users are relatively familiar with."
