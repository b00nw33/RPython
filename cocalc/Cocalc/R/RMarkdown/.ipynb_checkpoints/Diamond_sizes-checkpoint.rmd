## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only 
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than
2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```

If you prefer that data be displayed with additional formatting you can use the knitr::kable function. The code below generates Table 27.1.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  mtcars[1:10, ],
  caption = "A knitr kable."
)
```

RMarkdown combines the simplicity of `Markdown` with the flexibility of `Latex` allowing you to input mathematical equations within pdf documents.

1. Text with `in line` $\beta$ `code`  or ...
1. `Check` with \texttt{in line $\beta$ code}.

$$x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

```{=latex}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
A & B \\
A & B \\
\end{tabular}

\begin{align}
v^2 &= u^2+2as \\
& = \exp(mt) \star \left\{\frac{l}{2\sqrt{\pi t^3}} \exp(-l^2/{4t})\right\} \\
& = F_1 * F_2
\end{align}
```

Another way to include `Latex` content is as follows: `r paste0("$\\beta$ = ", mean(mtcars$mpg))`

For inline formulas, enclose the formula in `$…$`. For displayed formulas, use `$$…$$`. These render differently. For example, type $\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$ to show (which is inline mode) or type $$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$ to show as formula.

Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>
long time, so long<br/>
that the text does<br/>
not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
v^2 &=u^2+2as \\
10^2 &=u^2+2(10)(3.2) \\
u^2 &=100-64 \\
&=36 \\
u&=\sqrt{36} \\
&=6ms^{-1}
\end{align*}
```
