## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
# str(babynames)
str(mpg)
```

Here, we try executing `python` code:

```{python}
[2*i+3 for i in range(10)]
```
`Python` working well, so we get the simplicity of `Markdown` combined with `r` and `python` just by using `RMarkdown`.

What about `Mermaid` diagrams? Looks like the `DiagrammeR` library loaded properly, but I can't get the diagram codes to work.

```{r diagram}

# DiagrammeR::grViz("
#   digraph graph2 {
  
#   graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]
  
#   # node definitions with substituted label text
#   node [shape = oval]
#   a [label = '@@1']
#   b [label = '@@2']
#   c [label = '@@3']
#   d [label = '@@4']
  
#   a -> b -> c -> d
#   }
  
#   [1]: names(iris)[1]
#   [2]: names(iris)[2]
#   [3]: names(iris)[3]
#   [4]: names(iris)[4]
#   ",
#   height = 100)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only 
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than
2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```

If you prefer that data be displayed with additional formatting you can use the knitr::kable function. The code below generates Table 27.1.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:10,], caption = "A knitr kable.")
```

RMarkdown combines the simplicity of `Markdown` with the flexibility of `Latex` allowing you to input mathematical equations within pdf documents.

1. Text with `in line` $\beta$ `code`  or ...
1. `Check` with \texttt{in line $\beta$ code}.

$$x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

```{=latex}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
A & B \\
A & B \\
\end{tabular}

\begin{align}
v^2 &= u^2+2as \\
& = \exp(mt) \star \left\{\frac{l}{2\sqrt{\pi t^3}} \exp(-l^2/{4t})\right\} \\
& = F_1 * F_2
\end{align}
```

Another way to include `Latex` content is as follows: `r paste0("$\\beta$ = ", mean(mtcars$mpg))`

For inline formulas, enclose the formula in `$…$`. For displayed formulas, use `$$…$$`. These render differently. For example, type $\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$ to show (which is inline mode) or type $$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$ to show as formula.


```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>
long time, so long<br/>
that the text does<br/>
not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
v^2 &=u^2+2as \\
10^2 &=u^2+2(10)(3.2) \\
u^2 &=100-64 \\
&=36 \\
u&=\sqrt{36} \\
&=6ms^{-1}
\end{align*}
```
